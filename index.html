        <p>"So, any of you ever watched those Warner Bros. cartoons? Sometimes there's that one where that guy is having a tough
        time trying to make a decision. He's got an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. Seems pretty obvious,
        right? Usually it's the angel who is kind of the one trying to give him the good advice while the devil is trying to get
        him to do what's bad for him. It's not always that simple though. Most times they're not really angels or devils.
        They're just friends giving you advice, looking out for your best interest but not really understanding what's going to
        be best for you. So it kind of comes down to you. You have to make the decision yourself... This song is called H."</p>
